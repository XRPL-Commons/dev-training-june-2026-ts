# XRPL Developer Training - June 5, 2026

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/XRPL-Commons/dev-training-june-2026-ts)

This repository is the hands-on environment for the XRPL Commons developer training. Participants work from scaffolded TypeScript exercises. Mentors can track progress through Google Chat and verify the final work on XRPL Testnet.

> **TypeScript-only edition** — this repo contains only TypeScript exercises. No Python or Java.

## What Is In This Repo

```

Complete solutions live on the `solutions` branch.

## Getting Started

### 1. Open Codespaces

Click the button above and wait for the environment to finish starting.

The Codespace automatically:

- installs TypeScript and Node.js dependencies
- creates two funded XRPL Testnet wallets
- saves them to `wallets.json`
- silently notifies mentors in Google Chat that you started

Prebuild note:

- this repository is configured so dependency installation runs during Codespaces prebuild creation
- wallet minting still runs only when each participant's Codespace starts, so wallets stay unique per participant

### 2. Run the Exercises

All exercises are TypeScript files in `exercises/typescript/`.

| Exercise | File | Run command |
|---|---|---|
| Day 1: Send XRP | `day1-send-xrp.ts` | `npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day1-send-xrp.ts` |
| Homework: NFT | `homework-nft.ts` | `npx ts-node exercises/typescript/homework-nft.ts` |
| Day 2 Step 1 | `day2-step1-setup-account.ts` | `npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step1-setup-account.ts` |
| Day 2 Step 2 | `day2-step2-issue-token.ts` | `npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step2-issue-token.ts` |
| Day 2 Step 3 | `day2-step3-create-amm.ts` | `npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step3-create-amm.ts` |

Or use npm scripts from within `exercises/typescript/`:

```bash
cd exercises/typescript
npm run day1
npm run homework
npm run step1
npm run step2
npm run step3
```

### 3. Complete the Exercises

Each exercise contains TODO blocks with type-annotated hints. Fill them in, run the file, and confirm success in the XRPL Testnet Explorer.

## Exercise Commands

### Day 1: Send XRP

```bash
npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day1-send-xrp.ts
# or: cd exercises/typescript && npm run day1
```

Success signal: `tesSUCCESS` and an Explorer link.

### Homework: NFT Lifecycle

```bash
npx ts-node exercises/typescript/homework-nft.ts
# or: cd exercises/typescript && npm run homework
```

Success signal: NFT mint succeeds, appears on-chain, then is burned.

### Day 2 Step 1: Setup Account

```bash
npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step1-setup-account.ts
# or: cd exercises/typescript && npm run step1
```

Success signal: issuer account enables `Default Ripple`.

### Day 2 Step 2: Issue Token

```bash
npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step2-issue-token.ts
# or: cd exercises/typescript && npm run step2
```

Success signal: holder trust line exists and receives the issued token.

### Day 2 Step 3: Create AMM

Prerequisite: complete Step 1 and Step 2 first.

```bash
npx ts-node exercises/typescript/day2-step3-create-amm.ts
# or: cd exercises/typescript && npm run step3
```

Success signal: `AMMCreate` succeeds and the pool exists on Testnet.

## Automatic Progress Tracking

Participants do not need to run any tracking commands.

Tracking is silent and automatic:

- when a Codespace starts and wallets are minted, mentors get a startup signal
- a hidden background watcher monitors XRPL Testnet activity for that participant's wallets
- when a milestone transaction appears on-chain, mentors get a Google Chat update
- when Day 2 Step 3 succeeds, the final deliverable is submitted automatically

Each notification includes:

- the participant GitHub username from Codespaces
- the stage they completed
- their XRPL Testnet wallet addresses
- Explorer links that mentors can review later

## How Prerequisites Are Verified

Verification is based on actual XRPL transaction history, not file edits or Codespace creation.

The hidden watcher looks for:

- Day 1 XRP payment
- NFT mint and burn
- `AccountSet` enabling `Default Ripple`
- `TrustSet` plus issued token payment
- `AMMCreate`

This is the defensible answer to "did they actually complete it?" because it checks ledger activity directly.

## Organizer Setup: Google Chat Hook

This repo supports Google Chat incoming webhooks.

Setup steps:

1. Create an incoming webhook in the mentor Google Chat space.
2. In GitHub, add a Codespaces repository secret named `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL`.
3. Use the webhook URL value from Google Chat.
4. New participant Codespaces will automatically post a startup event when wallets are minted.
5. Exercise success events and the final deliverable will also post automatically in the background.
6. In GitHub repository settings, open `Settings -> Codespaces -> Prebuild configuration` and create a prebuild for `main`.
7. Choose the nearest region for participants, for example `West Europe` for this workshop.

Participants do not need to know or paste the webhook URL.

Google documents incoming webhooks as one-way notifications into a Chat space, which matches this workshop use case:

- https://developers.google.com/workspace/chat/quickstart/webhooks

## Mentor Support

If participants are blocked, send them to a Zoom breakout room and route them to one of:

- Tushar Pardhe
- Florian
- Thomas
- Mathis

## Wallets

After startup, `wallets.json` contains two funded Testnet wallets:

- Wallet 1: sender, issuer, minter
- Wallet 2: receiver, holder

Important:

- these are Testnet wallets only
- never reuse Testnet seeds on Mainnet
- you can re-mint them with `npx ts-node scripts/mint-wallets.ts`

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to do |
|---|---|
| Wallet minting fails | Retry `npx ts-node scripts/mint-wallets.ts` after a short wait. |
| TypeScript compile error | Check that `ts-node` and `typescript` are installed: `npm install` in `exercises/typescript/`. |
| WebSocket connection fails | Retry on a different network if corporate firewall rules block WebSockets. |
| Day 2 Step 3 fails | Complete Step 1 and Step 2 first, then retry. |
| Progress message does not reach mentors | Confirm the `GOOGLE_CHAT_WEBHOOK_URL` Codespaces secret is set. |

## Solutions Branch

If a participant gets stuck, complete solutions are available on the `solutions` branch:

```bash
git checkout solutions -- solutions/
```
